# Agile-Fixed-Wing-Motion-Planning

Code associated with Ph.D. thesis: Maneuver Design and Motion Planning for Agile Fixed-Wing UAVs

A maneuver space of optimal and dynamically feasible agile fixed-wing UAV trajectories are integrated into a real-time motion planner based on the Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (RRT) algorithm.
